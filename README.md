üçï Pizza Sales Analysis

üìä Project Summary:-
This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data to uncover meaningful business insights that can drive better decision-making in product offerings,
pricing strategies, and customer behavior.
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales metrics, order patterns, and product performance across multiple dimensions such as time of day, price range, pizza category, and individual items.

Using Power BI,
the dashboard presents key performance indicators (KPIs) including total sales, total orders, and quantities sold, supported by slicers and visual filters for dynamic exploration.
It enables stakeholders to evaluate top-selling pizzas, peak ordering hours, and customer preferences, making it a powerful tool for data-driven restaurant management.
